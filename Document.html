                     <p>A little over 8 million people live in New York City. That means 1 in every 38 people in the United States call the city home.
                            More than 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. 4 in 10 households speak a language other than English.
                            Oysters were so popular in New York in the 19th century that the shells were used to pave Pearl Street. They were also used for lime for the masonry of the Trinity Church.
                            France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1886 for its centennial celebration. The statue was shipped as 350 pieces in 214 crates and took 4 months to assemble at its current home on Ellis Island.</p>

                      <h1>District Six Museum</h1>
                        <img src="file:///home/codex/projects/web_page/district.jpeg" width="250" height="160" ;="">
                        <p>District Six Museum is a museum in the former inner-city residential area, District Six, in Cape Town, South Africa.
            
                                District Six Foundation was founded in 1989 and the museum in 1994, as a memorial to the forced movement of 60,000 inhabitants of various races in District Six during Apartheid in South Africa in the 1970s.[1]
                                
                                The floor of the museum is covered with a big map of the district with hand written notes of former inhabitants, which indicate where their houses were located. One former resident is jazz musician, Abdullah Ibrahim, better known by the name Dollar Brand. Other pieces in the museum are old traffic signs, exhibits of historical moments and lives of families from the area, historical declarations, and exhibits about the demolition.[1][2]</p>
                        
                                <h1>Castle of Good Hope</h1>
                                <img src="./Document_files/the_castle_of_good_hope_cape_town.jpg" width="250" height="160" ;="">
                                <p>Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest surviving building in South Africa and has been the centre of civilian, political and military life at the Cape from approximately 1679.

                                        In its current state, the Castle arguably represents one of the best preserved 17th century DEIC architecture on the entire globe.   The 2015 – 2016 renovation of the Castle – the first in 20 years – will further enhance its appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                                        
                                        This historical building now houses, among others, the William Fehr Collection managed by Iziko Museums of South Africa, an permanent ceramic exhibition (FIRED) and the Castle Military Museum.
                                        
                                        </p>

                                <h1>Long street</h1>
                                        <img src="file:///home/codex/projects/web_page/Longstreet.jpg" width="250" height="160" ;="">
                                        <p>One of the oldest streets in the city, Long Street lies in the heart of Cape Town’s city bowl and is most certainly on every tourist’s must see list. Stretching along more than 20 blocks of Cape Town's CBD, it lives up to its name and can take lazy strollers a full day to explore. 

 

                                                Proudly lined with unique old architecture, dating back to the early 1800s - this historic street is filled with second-hand book stores, antique stores, ethnic restaurants, trendy shops, backpackers, clubs and pulsing bars.  
                                                
                                                 
                                                
                                                The variety of colourful Victorian-era buildings is a delight to behold. You’ll find Victorian verandas with broekie lace, alongside Muslim Mosques - mingling in a surprisingly appealing clash of cultures. The buildings are still in relatively good condition, thanks to a number of preservation societies, heritage groups and architects who are constantly protecting these structures from the wrecking ball. In fact, many of the buildings have been restored over the years.
