                York City. That
                means 1 in every 38 people in the United States call
                the city home.
                More than 800 languages are spoken in New York City, making it the most linguistically diverse city in
                the
                world. 4 in 10 households speak a language other than English.
                Oysters were so popular in New York in the 19th century that the shells were used to pave Pearl Street.
                They
                were also used for lime for the masonry of the Trinity Church.
                France gifted the Statue of Liberty to the United States in 1886 for its centennial celebration. The
                statue was
                shipped as 350 pieces in 214 crates and took 4 months to assemble at its current home on Ellis Island.

                <img class="right" src="museum1.jpg" width="250" height="160" ; float:right ;>

                <ul>
                    <li>District Six Museum is a museum in the former inner-city residential area, District Six, in Cape
                        Town,
                        Sout Africa.</li>

                    <li>District Six Foundation was founded in 1989 and the museum in 1994, as a memorial to the forced
                        movement
                        of 60,000 inhabitants of various races in District Six during Apartheid in South Africa in the
                        1970s.[1]
                    </li>

                    <li>The floor of the museum is covered with a big map of the district with hand written notes of
                        former
                        inhabitants, which indicate where their houses were located. One former resident is jazz
                        musician, Abdullah
                        Ibrahim, better known by the name Dollar Brand. Other pieces in the museum are old traffic
                        signs, exhibits
                        of
                        historical moments and lives of families from the area, historical declarations, and exhibits
                        about the
                        demolition.[1][2]</li>

                <h1>Castle of Good Hope</h1>
                <img class="left" src="castle1.jpg" width="250" height="160" ;>

                <ul>
                    <li>Built between 1666 and 1679, the Castle is known as the oldest surviving building in South
                        Africa and has
                        been the centre of civilian, political and military life at the Cape from approximately 1679.
                    </li>

                    <li>In its current state, the Castle arguably represents one of the best preserved 17th century DEIC
                        architecture
                        on the entire globe. The 2015 – 2016 renovation of the Castle – the first in 20 years – will
                        further enhance
                        its appeal and position it well to become South Africa’s next UNESCO World Heritage Site.</li>

                    <li>This historical building now houses, among others, the William Fehr Collection managed by Iziko
                        Museums of
                        South Africa, an permanent ceramic exhibition (FIRED) and the Castle Military Museum.</li>

                <img class="right" src="street1.jpg" width="250" height="160" ; float: right;>
                <ul>
                    <li>One of the oldest streets in the city, Long Street lies in the heart of Cape Town’s city bowl
                        and is most
                        certainly on every tourist’s must see list. Stretching along more than 20 blocks of Cape Town's
                        CBD, it
                        lives
                        up to its name and can take lazy strollers a full day to explore.

                    <li>The variety of colourful Victorian-era buildings is a delight to behold. You’ll find Victorian
                        verandas
                        with
                        broekie lace, alongside Muslim Mosques - mingling in a surprisingly appealing clash of cultures.
                    </li>

                    <li>The buildings are still in relatively good condition, thanks to a number of preservation
                        societies,
                        heritage groups and
                        architects who are constantly protecting these structures from the wrecking ball. In fact, many
                        of the
                        .castle buildings have been restored over the years.</li>
